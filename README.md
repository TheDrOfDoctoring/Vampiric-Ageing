# Vampiric Ageing

This is a highly configurable addon for Vampirism that adds an Ageing Mechanic based on the players time spent as a vampire, or their number of infected entities.

By default, Ageing begins at Vampire Level 14 and to increase their Age Rank the player must infect a number of entities, the progress of which can be checked by interacting with a Coffin. The Age Rank can be seen above the player's blood bar.

Ageing goes up to a max rank of 5 with each rank further increasing the player's abilities, unlocking new ones, and potentially harshening the existing vulnerabilities of the vampire. 

# Abilities

By default, the player gains access to a number of benefits from ranking up:

- Increased health, scaling with Age Rank
- A reduction in Sun Damage, scaling with Age Rank
- Less Blood Drain, scaling with Age Rank
- Step Assist at Rank 2
- A new Action at Rank 3, which while active allows the player to drain blood from creatures they attack
- Waterwalking at Rank 4
- Vampires are now mostly unaffected by Powdered Snow

However, some penalties also come with increasing age:

- Increased vulnerability to Fire, Garlic and Holy Water scaling with Age Rank
- Rare chance to randomly gain the Bad Omen effect 
- Increased prices with villagers
